        "question": "Why should you use Vitroclean in your sand media filter?",
        "answer": "Vitroclean improves water clarity by filtering out finer particles than traditional silica sand, resulting in cleaner water. It is an environmentally friendly option made from 100% recycled glass, lasts 50% longer than silica sand, and is safe and easy to use without clumping or channeling. Additionally, it's cost-effective, reducing the frequency of filter replacements and maintenance. Vitroclean Advanced Filter Media offers superior water clarity with DE quality filtration down to 5 microns, is longer-lasting and environmentally friendly, and is easy to use without the clumping or channeling of regular silica sand.",

    {
        "question": "How do I install Vitroclean into my filter?",
        "answer": "1. Determine the Required Amount: First, you need to calculate the amount of Vitroclean needed for your filter. This is typically less than the amount of silica sand you would use. For example, 40 lbs of Vitroclean can replace 50 lbs of sand.\n\n2. Prepare the Filter: Before adding Vitroclean, make sure your filter is empty and any necessary repairs are made. Check that the laterals at the bottom of the filter are in good condition.\n\n3. Add Water and Base Layer: Fill the filter halfway with water. Then, slowly pour in Vitroclean Pebble or pea gravel to cover the laterals. This step is crucial, especially for larger filters, to ensure proper flow and diffusion.\n\n4. Add Vitroclean: After the base layer is in place, add the Vitroclean on top of it.\n\n5. Backwash the Filter: Once the Vitroclean is added, close the filter and backwash it until the water runs clear. This step is necessary to ensure that any residual dust from the Vitroclean is flushed out and the filter media is settled properly.",

    {
        "question": "How do I calculate the amount of Vitroclean I need for this filter?",
        "answer": "Take the amount of sand recommended by the filter manufacturer and multiply by 0.80. Vitroclean has a bulk density of 80 lbs per cubic foot. Vitroclean Pebble has a bulk density of 90 lbs per cubic foot. #20 silica sand has a bulk density of 100 lbs per cubic foot. Pea gravel has a bulk density of 100 to 130 lbs per cubic foot depending on the material.",

        "question": "How does Vitroclean compare to the other competitors?",
        "answer": "Vitroclean, a recycled glass filter media, offers superior filtration efficiency of 3 to 5 microns, outperforming traditional silica sand and competing closely with DE filter. It's environmentally friendly due to its recycled material composition. With a longer lifespan of up to 10 years, it surpasses both silica sand and zeolite in durability, making it a cost-effective choice despite a higher initial price. Vitroclean requires less maintenance, further enhancing its long-term economic benefits compared to other filter media. Not all glass filter media is equal. Vitroclean is of superior quality and size consistancy compared to other glass filter media.",

    },
    {
        "question": "Do I need to use pea gravel or Vitroclean Pebble in this installation?",
        "answer": "We recommend using Vitroclean Pebble of 1/8 x 1/16 clean pea gravel in the bottom of filters which require more than 400 lbs of media. This provides better backwash flow.",

    {
        "question": "How often should Vitroclean be replaced in a pool filter?",
        "answer": "Vitroclean typically lasts 50% longer than traditional silica sand used in pool filters. Generally, it should be replaced every 7 to 10 years, depending on the usage and maintenance of the pool.",
